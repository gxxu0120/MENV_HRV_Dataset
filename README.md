# MENV_HRV_Dataset
# Dataset Coming Soon

We are preparing to release **MENV_HRV_Dataset**, a large-scale dataset of synchronized mmWave radar signals and ECG-derived heartbeat timestamps.  
The dataset is designed to facilitate research on robust heart rate variability (HRV) estimation and related physiological sensing tasks.  
Details and documentation will be provided upon official release.

# Overview

- **Content**: Synchronized radar signals and heartbeat timestamps derived from ECG.  
  Due to privacy protection, only the ground-truth heartbeat timings are provided, not the raw ECG waveforms.

- **Applications**: physiological monitoring, cross-domain generalization

# Data Availability

To ensure strict ethical compliance and privacy protection, we are currently in the process of gradually securing release authorizations from participants and anonymizing the data. The dataset will be made publicly available in this repository once this process is complete.

Contact If you have an urgent need for the data for research purposes, please contact us via email at gxxu@mail.ustc.edu.cn to discuss potential early access.
